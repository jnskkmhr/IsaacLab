"""Privileged observations of the granular terrain.

These are the MPM counterparts of the hybrid soft-contact terms of ``g1_29dof_soft``: the foot
contact state comes from the reaction wrench that the coupler feeds back from the MPM entry to
the proxy feet, so every term here matches its soft-contact counterpart in shape and units.
